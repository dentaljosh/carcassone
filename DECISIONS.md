# Architecture Decision Record

Every non-trivial technical decision gets logged here. The bar for "non-trivial" is: if Joshua looked at this code in 3 weeks and asked "why did we do it this way?" — would the answer be obvious from the code alone? If no, log it.

**Always log:** board representation choices, action space encoding, network architecture, hyperparameter values that aren't from a cited paper, framework/library choices, anything where you considered alternatives.

**Don't log:** variable names, file organization, formatting choices, library version pinning, anything that's purely a style decision.

## Decisions

## 2026-04-28 — Phase 2 acceptance: MCTS(s=20) wins 96/100 vs random + Q-tiebreak fix

**Result:** MCTS(s=20) defeated random in **96/100 games** (96.0%, avg score diff +30.9, 0 draws, 4 losses). Cleared the prompt's ≥95% acceptance criterion. Per-game results checkpointed to `data/tournament/s0020_seed*_p*.json` for reproducibility.

**Key fix mid-Phase-2:** the original `MCTS.best_action` chose the most-visited child by N. At low simulation budgets (s=10–20 with ~50 root actions), most children have N=1 — the choice between them is essentially arbitrary. Empirical signal: MCTS(s=10) won only ~47% vs random in the first run. Fixed by switching to `argmax_Q` with N as tiebreak; tournament re-ran and trended cleanly to 96%.

**Sims chosen for acceptance:** s=20 not s=100. Reason: per-game wallclock at s=10 was ~28 min; at s=20 ~11 min/game. The 2020 paper's s=100 was for beating Star2.5; for beating random, s=20 is plenty. Phase 4's NN-MCTS replaces vanilla anyway — vanilla MCTS is just a sparring partner here.

**Pre-Phase-3 perf wins (incidentally landed during Phase 2):**
- `get_valid_moves` 49.5ms → 1.75ms (28×) via engine adjacency tracking (`state.open_positions`)
- mid-game MCTS sim 25s → 1.78s (14×) via `apply_action_inplace` (skips deepcopy in rollout-discard path)

**Reversal cost:** none — this is a result, not a decision
**Phase:** Phase 2

---

## 2026-04-27 — Phase 4 prerequisite: get_valid_moves performance strategy (IMPLEMENTED, opt-in)

**Status update:** option A (wrapper-level cache) is now implemented in `src/carcassonne_ai/game_wrapper.py`, opt-in via `Game(enable_legal_moves_cache=True)`. Tests in `tests/test_legal_moves_cache.py` cover correctness, hit-rate stats, clear semantics, read-only protection on cached masks, and a 5x speedup floor. Default is OFF so Phase 1 fuzz tests don't accidentally rely on cache state. Phase 2 MCTS will pass `enable_legal_moves_cache=True` and call `clear_caches()` between root moves. Engine-level adjacency tracking (option B below) remains deferred — only revisit if the cache hit rate proves insufficient.

**Context:** Quick-bench showed `Game.get_valid_moves` at 49.5ms/call. Phase 4 MCTS will call it at every tree node. Estimate: 200 sims × ~70 moves × 100 games per iteration = 1.4M calls × 49.5ms = ~19 hours of pure get_valid_moves work per iteration. The prompt's plan estimated 30-45 min/iteration — this would blow that by ~25x and break Phase 4.

**Root cause:** `TilePositionFinder.possible_playing_positions` (engine) scans every cell of the 35×35 board (1225 cells) × 4 rotations × `TileFitter.fits` per cell = ~4900 fit-checks per call. Most cells are empty interior or empty-far-from-placed, never legal placements.

**Two complementary mitigations (both deferred until Phase 2 done; caching is the priority):**

### A. Wrapper-level legal-move cache (RECOMMENDED — implement before Phase 4)

**Cache key:** the subset of `string_representation` that affects the legal-move set:
- `(placed_tiles_with_orientation_grid, placed_meeples, current_player, phase, next_tile_signature, last_tile_action_coord_or_None)`.
- Excludes scores, deck-remaining-count, opponent meeple pool. Confirmed by reading `ActionUtil.get_possible_actions`, `TilePositionFinder`, and `PossibleMoveFinder`: the legal-move set depends only on those fields.

**Cache scope:** per-MCTS-search. Cleared between root moves. Avoids stale-state bugs without sacrificing hit rate (within one search the same nodes are revisited heavily).

**Invalidation:** none needed inside an MCTS search. Each tree node has a fixed state and we deepcopy on `apply_action`. Verified by `Game.get_next_state`: `copy.deepcopy(state)` before `StateUpdater.apply_action`. No in-place mutations leak across nodes.

**Memory budget:** action mask = 2511 bools = ~316 bytes packed. State key ≈ 300 bytes. ~600 bytes per entry. Max ~50K entries per search × 600 B ≈ 30 MB per worker. With 16 self-play workers: ~500 MB. Trivial on 32 GB.

**Expected speedup:** MCTS revisits a small set of root-vicinity nodes heavily during selection. Hit rate ≥ 90% in steady-state. Effective per-call cost drops from 49.5ms to <1ms (cache hit) + amortized 49.5ms × (1 - hit rate). Net: ~10x for Phase 4.

### B. Engine-level adjacency tracking (OPTIONAL — defer; revisit if cache underperforms)

**Idea:** maintain a `state.open_positions: set[Coordinate]` set updated incrementally on each placement: add the (up to 4) empty neighbors of the just-placed tile, remove the just-placed tile's coordinate. `TilePositionFinder` iterates `state.open_positions` instead of the full 35×35 grid.

**Speedup of cold (cache-miss) calls:** O(35²×4) → O(open_count × 4). Open count is typically 20-80 mid-game → 15-60x faster cold path.

**Effort:** ~1 day. Need to instrument `StateUpdater.apply_action` to maintain the set, verify no other engine path bypasses it, add tests.

**Memory:** negligible (~100 Coordinate objects = a few KB).

**Why deferred:** the cache alone probably suffices for Phase 4. The engine-level fix is a multiplicative improvement on cold-path latency that matters mostly when the cache hit rate is poor. Reassess after the cache lands.

### Combined plan
1. **Phase 2 (next):** implement vanilla MCTS without caching first to validate correctness against the 2020 paper's baseline.
2. **Pre-Phase 4:** add wrapper-level legal-move cache (option A). Re-bench. If <2 min/iteration achieved, ship it.
3. **If still too slow:** add engine-level adjacency tracking (option B).

**Reversal cost:** zero — both are pure-function caches/optimizations
**Phase:** Phase 1 (design); to implement before Phase 4

## 2026-04-27 — Phase 1 quick-bench results (per-call cost map)

**Context:** First profiling pass on the wrapper. Numbers from `scripts/bench_quick.py` on idle CPU.

| op | μs/call | note |
|---|---:|---|
| `Game.get_valid_moves` | 49,500 | dominant cost — engine enumerator |
| `Game.get_canonical_form` | 152 | board+scalar tensor build |
| `Game.string_representation` | 208 | repr hash |
| random self-play (1 worker) | 4.95 s/game | single-process baseline |
| random self-play (Pool x16) | 0.70 s/game | 7.11x speedup |
| GPU 4096² fp16 matmul | 2.80 ms | 49 TFLOPS effective |

**Implications:**
- `get_valid_moves` is ~99% of per-game cost. The engine's `ActionUtil.get_possible_actions` walks the 35×35 board scanning for legal placements; for Phase 4 self-play (with MCTS calling get_valid_moves at every node), this is the bottleneck to address. Possible mitigations (in priority order): cache the legal-move set per state hash; restrict the placement scan to tiles adjacent to placed tiles only; rewrite the inner loop in numpy/cython. Defer until Phase 4 confirms it's blocking.
- `get_canonical_form` and `string_representation` are negligible.
- ETA cheat-sheet (Pool x16 random self-play): 100 games ≈ 70s, 1000 games ≈ 12 min, 5000 games ≈ 58 min.

**Reversal cost:** N/A — measurements only
**Phase:** Phase 1

---

## 2026-04-27 — Phase 1 action-space encoding: phase-aware flat (size 2511)

**Context:** The original Phase 1 plan encoded a turn as `(position, rotation, meeple)` jointly into a single flat 38,440-dim action space. While reading the engine for Phase 1 implementation we discovered the engine treats one Carcassonne turn as **two sequential decisions** (`GamePhase.TILES` then `GamePhase.MEEPLES`). The agent never picks all three components simultaneously.

**Options considered:**
  - A: Unified flat encoding parameterized by phase. Tile half is `W*W*4 + 1` (placement + tile-pass). Meeple half is 11 (5 NORMAL sides + 4 FARMER corners + meeple-pass). Total = `W*W*4 + 11 = 2511` for W=25.
  - B: Two separate policy heads, routed by `state.phase`. Cleaner separation but doubles head count and adds plumbing.
  - C: Original 38,440-dim joint encoding. Would have ~95% of indices unreachable at any state.

**Decision:** chose A.

**Reason:** A matches engine reality (the mask is built directly from the engine's `get_possible_actions`), keeps the network output ~16x smaller than the original plan, and a single Coach/Arena training loop works without phase-aware routing. The `getValidMoves` mask zeroes off-phase indices, so training only ever sees same-phase logits as the active region.

**Reversal cost:** medium — the network policy head depends on this size; switching encodings requires retraining
**Phase:** Phase 1

---

## 2026-04-27 — Window size is a Game config parameter, not a hardcoded constant

**Context:** Phase 0 measurements suggested 25×25 fits 99% of random games with margin. But MCTS-driven play (Phase 2) and Phase 4 self-play may sprawl differently, and we don't want a major refactor if 25 turns out to be wrong.

**Options considered:**
  - A: Module-level `WINDOW_SIZE = 25` constant. Simple. Refactor needed if size changes.
  - B: Config parameter on `Game(window_size=25)`, threaded through `WindowOffset(size)`. Minor plumbing increase, but resizing is a one-line change at the call site.
  - C: Re-measure constantly and resize per-game. Overkill; breaks checkpoint compatibility.

**Decision:** chose B.

**Reason:** Joshua's explicit ask. The cost is small (`WindowOffset` already existed; just added a `size` field), and the freedom to re-train with a different window size in Phase 4 is worth more than the saved keystrokes. `DEFAULT_WINDOW_SIZE = 25` is the module default; tests parametrize over `{21, 25, 31}`.

**Reversal cost:** zero — already configurable
**Phase:** Phase 1

## 2026-04-27 — Parallel-worker count: use full SMT fan-out (16 on 5800X)

**Context:** Measurement and (later) self-play workers parallelize CPU-bound random-game simulation. Predicted SMT contention would cap useful parallelism at 8 (physical cores). Benchmarked it instead.

**Setup:** `scripts/bench_workers.py` runs 64 random games per pool size on AMD 5800X (8C/16T):

| workers | wall (s) | games/s | speedup |
|--------:|---------:|--------:|--------:|
|       1 |   286.20 |    0.22 |   1.00x |
|       4 |    80.53 |    0.79 |   3.55x |
|       8 |    51.73 |    1.24 |   5.53x |
|      14 |    43.67 |    1.47 |   6.55x |
|      16 |    41.61 |    1.54 |   6.88x |
|      17 |    43.56 |    1.47 |   6.57x |
|      18 |    42.71 |    1.50 |   6.70x |
|      24 |    41.04 |    1.56 |   6.97x |
|      32 |    42.40 |    1.51 |   6.75x |

Oversubscription (>16) was tested explicitly: 17 is slightly *worse* than 16, 18-20 is a wash, 24 wins by 1.4% (within single-run noise), 32 loses. **16 (`os.cpu_count()`) stays as the default** — 24 is at best a noise-level optimization, and going past that actively hurts.

**Decision:** use `os.cpu_count()` (16 logical) for measurement scripts and self-play.

**Reason:** Predicted SMT-sibling ALU contention didn't materialize. The engine is heavily Python-interpreter-bound — much of the per-instruction time is dispatch/GC/refcount overhead, which doesn't fight SMT siblings the way fused-FP code does. Diminishing returns past 8 are real (5.40x → 6.90x for 2x workers) but it's still strictly faster.

**Reversal cost:** zero — single config knob in two files
**Phase:** Phase 0

---

## 2026-04-27 — Phase 0 measurement results (random play only)

**Context:** Phase 0 step 0.7 — empirically measure the bounding-box size of placed tiles and the per-decision legal-action count, to replace the prompt's "31×31 window" and "alpha=0.3" guesses with data. CSVs live in `data/measurements/`.

**Setup:** 1000 random games for board size, 200 random games (33,084 decisions) for action space, both with `[BASE, THE_RIVER]` + `[FARMERS]`, 2 players.

**Board bounding box (1000 games):**
- width: p50=14, p99=20, max=22
- height: p50=15, p99=20, max=23
- longest side: p50=16, p99=21, max=23

**Action space (33,084 decisions):**
- min=1, mean=18.8, p50=4, p90=51, p99=68, max=96

**Implications (will revisit after Phase 2 MCTS measurements):**
- Window size: 25×25 fits 99% of random games with 4-tile margin. Plan default of 31×31 is overprovisioned for random play. **Holding 25×25 as a tentative target but will retry with MCTS games before committing** — MCTS-driven play tends to sprawl more than random.
- Action space max=96 << 500, so flat softmax with hard masking is comfortably tractable. No factored heads needed.
- Dirichlet alpha rule-of-thumb (10 / mean_legal_moves) ≈ 0.53. The prompt's default of 0.3 is in the right ballpark; 0.5 may train slightly faster. Sweep in Phase 4 hyperparameter pre-flight.

**Reversal cost:** measurements are reusable; window choice is parameterized
**Phase:** Phase 0

---

## 2026-04-27 — Vendor upstream repos rather than using git submodules

**Context:** Phase 0 needs to bring in the wingedsheep Carcassonne engine and the suragnair alpha-zero-general framework. The original prompt's setup snippet implied sibling clones with `pip install -e`.

**Options considered:**
  - A: Vendor (clone, drop `.git`, commit our copy). Pros: patches live in our git history; no submodule friction. Cons: drift from upstream; manual rebases if upstream improves.
  - B: Git submodules. Pros: clean provenance; explicit upstream version pinning. Cons: cannot patch the engine without first forking to our own GitHub fork; submodules add friction for solo development.
  - C: Sibling clone + `pip install -e`. Pros: lightest. Cons: patches live in untracked sibling clones — risk of losing them when switching machines or after a clean checkout.

**Decision:** chose A (vendor).

**Reason:** wingedsheep is unmaintained (last release Oct 2021) and we expect to need engine patches (farmer scoring is the most likely problem area). Vendoring puts patches in our own git history. License attribution preserved in `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/`.

**Reversal cost:** low (could re-extract to siblings later if needed)
**Phase:** Phase 0

## 2026-04-27 — Reward normalization: tanh(diff / 15) — UPDATED from /20 after measurement

**Context:** AlphaZero-General's value head expects values in [-1, 1]. Need to map Carcassonne score differentials onto that range so the value head trains efficiently — too tight saturates, too loose under-utilizes the range.

**Original choice (now superseded):** `tanh(diff / 20)`, reasoned from "typical close games are ±20" — an assumption, not a measurement.

**Empirical data (1000 random games, `scripts/measure_reward_distribution.py`):**

  diff (signed): min=-45, p1=-31, p5=-19, p25=-7, p50=-1, p75=+7, p95=+18, p99=+31, max=+59
  |diff|: mean=9.0, p50=7, p90=19, p95=24, p99=35

  | D | in [-0.9, +0.9] | saturated (>=0.99) |
  |--:|---:|---:|
  | 10 | 81.7% | 3.7% |
  | **15** | **93.7%** | **0.6%** |
  | 20 | 97.5% | 0.1% |
  | 25 | 99.1% | 0.0% |
  | 30 | 99.6% | 0.0% |

The target was ~90% of games in the non-saturated range with headroom. /20 puts 97.5% in non-sat — under-utilizes the [-1, +1] range, weaker gradient than optimal. /15 is the closest fit at 93.7% non-sat / 0.6% saturated.

**Updated decision:** `tanh(diff / 15)`. Code: `SCORE_NORM_SCALE = 15.0` in `src/carcassonne_ai/game_wrapper.py`.

**Forward-looking note — revisit after Phase 3:** trained-bot games will have a tighter score-differential distribution than random games (the bots stop blowing each other out). Anticipate switching `SCORE_NORM_SCALE` from 15 to **10** at that point. The plan:

1. After Phase 3 warm-start, save 1000 self-play games' (score_p0, score_p1, diff) to `data/measurements/phase3_selfplay_diff.csv` (one row per game).
2. Run `python scripts/measure_reward_distribution.py --source csv --csv data/measurements/phase3_selfplay_diff.csv` (the script is parameterized to accept arbitrary CSV input — random play now, network self-play in Phase 3, trained-bot self-play in Phase 4).
3. Pick the new D from the empirical table (target ~90% non-saturated). Likely 10, possibly 8.
4. If D changes by >20%, update `SCORE_NORM_SCALE` and follow the migration plan below.

**Migration plan for D = 15 → 10 (or whatever Phase 3 indicates):**
- **Default: retrain value head from scratch.** The Phase 3 warm-start is supervised learning on heuristic-labeled positions — labels are cheap to regenerate by re-running the heuristic with the new D. Throw away the /15 weights, regenerate labels with the new D, retrain. This is what alpha-zero-general supports natively and is the cleanest path. Cost: a few hours of supervised training on cached positions.
- **Alternative (rejected unless retraining proves expensive):** label transformation — `tanh(diff/10) ≈ tanh(1.5 * atanh(value_at_15))` lets us reuse /15 weights as a warm start. More elegant and saves training time, but introduces approximation error and requires custom code in the training loop. Reject by default; revisit only if Phase 3 retraining turns out to dominate iteration time.

**Reversal cost:** medium (value-head retrain on cached positions; cheap relative to Phase 4 self-play cost)
**Phase:** Phase 1

## 2026-04-27 — Window-overflow handling: drop the game

**Context:** Centered sliding window encoding will occasionally have games sprawl past the window dimensions. Need to decide what happens.

**Options considered:**
  - A: Drop the game from training, log warning.
  - B: Dynamic per-move re-centering. Adds a coordinate-translation step to MCTS state hashing — bug risk.
  - C: Grow the window post-hoc on threshold breach. Adds checkpoint-incompatibility risk between training iterations.

**Decision:** chose A.

**Reason:** With window sized at empirical 99th-pct + 4-tile margin, overflow rate should be <1%. Dropping the game is by far the simplest mechanism. We will track overflow count as a metric and revisit if rate exceeds 0.5% in real self-play data.

**Reversal cost:** low (window size is parameterized; can resize and retrain)
**Phase:** Phase 1

---

## 2026-04-27 — Patch wingedsheep engine: ties award full points to all tied players

**Context:** Phase 0 sanity checks revealed that `PointsCollector.get_winning_player` returned `None` whenever multiple players tied for most meeples on a feature. The caller code awarded zero points in that case. This contradicts the official Carcassonne rules ("if tied, all tied players score full points") and is especially load-bearing for our scope because farmer fields are frequently contested.

**Options considered:**
  - A: Patch the engine in place (vendored fork) — rename `get_winning_player` → `get_winning_players` (returns a list), iterate at all 5 call sites, award points to each.
  - B: Wrap the engine and post-process scores. Fragile — callers compute scores in tight loops during state updates and re-deriving the right answer externally is error-prone.
  - C: Live with the buggy behavior. Unacceptable: farmer scoring is the most subtle and most-contested feature; getting it wrong silently corrupts the value-head training signal.

**Decision:** chose A.

**Reason:** Vendoring was justified specifically for this kind of patch. The change is local to `points_collector.py` and verified by a new sanity check (tied 2-tile road → both players score 2 pts).

**Reversal cost:** low (single file diff)
**Phase:** Phase 0

---

## 2026-04-27 — Patch wingedsheep engine: lazy tkinter import

**Context:** `CarcassonneGame.__init__` eagerly instantiated `CarcassonneVisualiser`, which imports tkinter at module load. WSL2 doesn't have python3-tk by default, and headless training never needs the visualiser.

**Options considered:**
  - A: Make visualiser instantiation lazy in `render()`. Existing call sites continue to work.
  - B: Add `python3-tk` as a system-package requirement. Pushes complexity onto every developer/CI machine.
  - C: Strip the visualiser entirely. Loses an occasionally useful debug tool.

**Decision:** chose A.

**Reason:** Smallest patch with no API change. `render()` still works when the user actually calls it (and tkinter is installed).

**Reversal cost:** low
**Phase:** Phase 0

---

## 2026-04-27 — Patch wingedsheep engine: silence print statements behind module flag

**Context:** `points_collector.py` had 15 `print()` calls that fired on every scoring event. At 100 games the noise was acceptable; for 100K+ self-play positions it would dominate stdout and slow training.

**Options considered:**
  - A: Replace prints with a module-level `_log()` that's gated on `CARCASSONNE_VERBOSE` env var (default off).
  - B: Replace with Python `logging` and a custom logger. More flexible but pulls in handler config we don't need.
  - C: Live with the prints and redirect stdout in our scripts. Pollutes test output and other tooling.

**Decision:** chose A.

**Reason:** Minimal change, opt-in verbosity for debugging, no logging-config plumbing.

**Reversal cost:** low
**Phase:** Phase 0
